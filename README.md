# Pokémon Performance Analysis Using SQL and Power BI
This project builds an automated pipeline that scrapes Pokémon data from PokémonDB, stores it in a self-hosted SQL database, and analyzes the data using Power BI. The analysis focuses on identifying high-performing and statistically strong Pokémon based on key performance metrics, whether that is speed, defense or overall total stats.

## Things I learned ✅
-   ** Basic usage of Bs4 library for Webscrabing and digging through a sites html code
-   ** Using Pandas for simple Transform and Datacleaning.Some Data cleaning is also done when webscraping.
-   ** MYSQL and a of DAX function in PowerBi, embedding image, custom DAX function and Measures to show current item/pokemon vs the Average Performace and many others
-   ** PowerBI visualization: filters, graphs and overall creating a visually aesthetic dashboard

## How to Navigate this Project
-   ** Screenshots is home to images of my dashboards and some of its functions
-   ** Datascraper.py is the main webscraping and data collecting script.
-   ** Database_Schema.sql is my sql code for creating the actual Schema
